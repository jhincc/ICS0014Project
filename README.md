#ICS0014Project

##What?
A JavaFX 2 Towers of Hanoi game with a simple highscores table from database.

The goal of this project was to use as many new(to me) technologies from this course as I could, 
which is why I used SceneBuilder as lot as I could

This is the final project for the Tallinn University of Technology class ICS0014 Java Technologies
